# Os-Ticket
This repository documents my hands-on experience setting up and using OS Ticket, an open-source help desk ticketing system.

## 🛠️ Lab Objectives  
✔ Deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) in **Microsoft Azure**  
✔ Install and configure **OS Ticket** on the VM  
✔ Set up **IIS (Windows)** for web hosting  
✔ Configure **MySQL** for database management  
✔ Create and manage tickets within OS Ticket  
✔ Explore **help desk workflows** in a cloud-hosted environment  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft Azure** (Cloud hosting)  
- **Windows Server** (Deployed OS Ticket on a VM)  
- **OS Ticket** (Help desk ticketing system)  
- **IIS** (Web hosting for OS Ticket)  
- **MySQL** (Database backend)

## ☁️ Azure overall Deployment Steps  
1. **Created a Virtual Machine (VM)** in Azure   
2. **Configured networking** (Allowed HTTP, HTTPS, RDP, and MySQL ports)  
3. **Installed OS Ticket** and its required dependencies  
4. **Set up IIS (Windows)** for web access  
5. **Configured MySQL database** and linked it to OS Ticket  
6. **Tested ticket submission and resolution workflows**

 ### **Step 2: Connect to the Virtual Machine**  
1. If using **Windows Server**, connect via **Remote Desktop (RDP)**

![Remote Desktop Connection 2_25_2025 9_37_42 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b703273-a7f2-4fac-aa56-a1f70d5fddd0)

### **Step 3: Install OS Ticket and Dependencies**

1. Download the osTicket-Installation-Files.zip and unzip it onto your desktop. The folder should be called “osTicket-Installation-Files”
   - We will use the files in this folder to install osTicket and some dependencies.
2. Install / Enable IIS in Windows WITH CGI
   - World Wide Web Services -> Application Development Features -> [X] CGI

  ![IIS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5261853-1701-44dc-916b-065672278d93)

3. From the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder, install PHP Manager for IIS
4. From the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder install the Rewrite Module
5. Create the directory C:\PHP and from the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder, unzip PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip) into the “C:\PHP” folder
6. From the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder, install VC_redist.x86.exe.
7. From the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder, install MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi)
   - Typical Setup
   - Launch Configuration Wizard
   - Standard Configuration

9. Reload IIS (Open IIS, Stop and Start the server)
10. Install osTicket v1.15.8
    - From the “osTicket-Installation-Files” folder, unzip “osTicket-v1.15.8.zip” and copy the “upload” folder into “c:\inetpub\wwwroot”
    - Within “c:\inetpub\wwwroot”, Rename “upload” to “osTicket”.
11. Reload IIS (Open IIS, Stop and Start the server)
12. Go to sites -> Default -> osTicket
    - On the right, click “Browse *:80”
